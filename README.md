Implement a single page ReactJS application fetching and displaying stock data:  There should be an input at the top receiving the symbol, for example TSLA for Tesla, then the application should fetch stock data to display current value, variation, previous close, open, bid, ask, market cap, volume, avg volume and display a chart with the last 24 hours performance. (no need to add 5d, 1m or more ranges).  Choose any free available API that can offer you the required data and feel free to use any chart library.  Please apply styles in the way you prefer, you donâ€™t have to follow the same layout and design as Yahoo Finance.
